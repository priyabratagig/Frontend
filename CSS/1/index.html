    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li>
    <li>
      CSS describes how HTML elemetns are to be displayed on screen, paper, or
      in other medida.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="strick"> CSS is not necessary</span><span class="highlight">CSS saves a lot of work</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="underline italic">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files.</span>

  </ol>
  <h2 class="head">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
  <ul class="monospace">
    <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsl</li>
    <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
    <li>
      External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.
    </li>
    <li>
      The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS
      files. However,
      <span class="highlight">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this
        is easier to demonstrate,</span>
      and easier for you to try it yourself.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a
    style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one
    unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to
    link directly to an element and itâ€™s used by JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>
    In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
    elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set
    of styles can be applied to the element.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly
    used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style
    should be applied.
